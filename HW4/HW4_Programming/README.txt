Environment required:
Python 2.7.13 -- Anaconda 4.3.0 (64-bit)

*PLEASE NOTE
	- Your code must run in Python 2.7.13 -- Anaconda 4.3.0 (64-bit) out of the box
	- The folder/file structure for the code files does not matter. Place the files in any directory you'd like, but you must keep the exact names.

For each dataset, it contains 3 columns, with the format: x1 \t x2 \t cluster_label. You need to use the first two columns for clustering, and the last column for evaluation.

1. You are required to fill in where it states “Please Fill Missing Lines here”.

Information about code files:

*DataPoints.py
	Helper class/functions.
	
*KMeans.py
	1. The file prints results from the algorithm run on all three datasets.
	2. Points with cluster labels are stored in KMeans.csv (currently stores the result of dataset 3; change the last dataset run for other dataset results).
		
*DBSCAN.py
	1. The file prints results from the algorithm run on all three datasets.
	2. Points with cluster labels are stored in DBSCAN_dataset3.csv (currently stores the result of dataset 3; change the last dataset run for other dataset results).

*GMM.py
	1. The file prints results from the algorithm run on all three datasets.
	2. Points with cluster labels are stored in GMM.csv (currently stores the result of dataset 3; change the last dataset run for other dataset results).
